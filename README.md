## Features:

| S.N | Type | Features | Description |

| 2 | Required | Text Search | Enter any text ( apart from capitalised format of months ) to enable a text search in the current monthly and overall view |
| 3 | Required | Filter by Product | On initial load, the Select boxes are configured to compare Products A and B. Change the selection here to fetch data for two other products. Choosing the same Product renders an error message |
